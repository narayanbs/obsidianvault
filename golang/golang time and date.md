Go's `time` package is one of the most important standard libraries you'll use. It handles timestamps, time zones, formatting, parsing, durations, timers, and scheduling.

This tutorial goes from beginner to advanced with practical examples.

# Go Time & Date Tutorial

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)
```

---

# 1. Getting Current Time

The simplest operation:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    now := time.Now()

    fmt.Println(now)
}
```

Example output:

```
2026-07-16 15:24:31.123456 +0530 IST
```

---

# 2. Accessing Individual Components

```go
now := time.Now()

fmt.Println(now.Year())
fmt.Println(now.Month())
fmt.Println(now.Day())

fmt.Println(now.Hour())
fmt.Println(now.Minute())
fmt.Println(now.Second())

fmt.Println(now.Nanosecond())

fmt.Println(now.Weekday())
fmt.Println(now.Location())
```

Output:

```
2026
July
16
15
24
31
123456789
Thursday
IST
```

---

# 3. Creating a Specific Date

Use `time.Date`.

```go
birthday := time.Date(
    1998,
    time.December,
    5,
    14,
    30,
    0,
    0,
    time.UTC,
)

fmt.Println(birthday)
```

Output:

```
1998-12-05 14:30:00 +0000 UTC
```

Parameters:

```
Year
Month
Day
Hour
Minute
Second
Nanoseconds
Location
```

---

# 4. Time Zones

UTC:

```go
utc := time.Now().UTC()
```

Load another timezone:

```go
loc, err := time.LoadLocation("America/New_York")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

nyTime := time.Now().In(loc)

fmt.Println(nyTime)
```

Another example:

```go
tokyo, _ := time.LoadLocation("Asia/Tokyo")

fmt.Println(time.Now().In(tokyo))
```

---

# 5. Unix Timestamp

Current Unix time:

```go
fmt.Println(time.Now().Unix())
```

Milliseconds:

```go
fmt.Println(time.Now().UnixMilli())
```

Microseconds:

```go
fmt.Println(time.Now().UnixMicro())
```

Nanoseconds:

```go
fmt.Println(time.Now().UnixNano())
```

Create time from Unix:

```go
t := time.Unix(1752670000, 0)

fmt.Println(t)
```

---

# 6. Formatting Time

Unlike many languages, Go uses a reference date:

```
Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006
```

Every format is created using this exact date.

Example:

```go
now := time.Now()

fmt.Println(now.Format("2006-01-02"))
```

Output

```
2026-07-16
```

Date + time:

```go
fmt.Println(now.Format("2006-01-02 15:04:05"))
```

Output

```
2026-07-16 15:24:31
```

12-hour clock:

```go
fmt.Println(now.Format("03:04 PM"))
```

Output

```
03:24 PM
```

Pretty format:

```go
fmt.Println(now.Format("Monday, January 2, 2006"))
```

Output

```
Thursday, July 16, 2026
```

---

# 7. Common Layouts

RFC3339

```go
fmt.Println(time.Now().Format(time.RFC3339))
```

Example

```
2026-07-16T15:24:31+05:30
```

RFC822

```go
fmt.Println(time.Now().Format(time.RFC822))
```

Kitchen

```go
fmt.Println(time.Now().Format(time.Kitchen))
```

Example

```
3:24PM
```

---

# 8. Parsing Dates

Convert string → time.

```go
date := "2026-07-16"

t, err := time.Parse("2006-01-02", date)

if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

fmt.Println(t)
```

Another example:

```go
timestamp := "2026-07-16 14:30:15"

t, _ := time.Parse(
    "2006-01-02 15:04:05",
    timestamp,
)

fmt.Println(t)
```

---

# 9. Adding Time

Add hours

```go
future := time.Now().Add(3 * time.Hour)
```

Add days

```go
future := time.Now().Add(24 * time.Hour)
```

Subtract

```go
past := time.Now().Add(-48 * time.Hour)
```

---

# 10. AddDate

Better for months and years.

```go
today := time.Now()

fmt.Println(today.AddDate(1, 0, 0))
```

One year later.

Months:

```go
today.AddDate(0, 3, 0)
```

Three months later.

---

# 11. Comparing Times

```go
a := time.Now()

b := a.Add(time.Hour)

fmt.Println(a.Before(b))
fmt.Println(a.After(b))
fmt.Println(a.Equal(b))
```

Output

```
true
false
false
```

---

# 12. Duration

Duration represents elapsed time.

```go
d := 5 * time.Second

fmt.Println(d)
```

Output

```
5s
```

Other units

```go
time.Nanosecond
time.Microsecond
time.Millisecond
time.Second
time.Minute
time.Hour
```

Example

```go
timeout := 30 * time.Second
```

---

# 13. Measuring Execution Time

```go
start := time.Now()

// Do work

time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)

elapsed := time.Since(start)

fmt.Println(elapsed)
```

Output

```
2.000234s
```

---

# 14. Sleeping

```go
fmt.Println("Start")

time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)

fmt.Println("Done")
```

---

# 15. Countdown Example

```go
for i := 5; i > 0; i-- {
    fmt.Println(i)
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
}

fmt.Println("Go!")
```

---

# 16. Timer

Runs once.

```go
timer := time.NewTimer(5 * time.Second)

<-timer.C

fmt.Println("Timer expired")
```

---

# 17. Ticker

Runs repeatedly.

```go
ticker := time.NewTicker(time.Second)

defer ticker.Stop()

for range ticker.C {
    fmt.Println("Tick")
}
```

Output

```
Tick
Tick
Tick
...
```

---

# 18. Time Until

```go
deadline := time.Now().Add(10 * time.Minute)

fmt.Println(time.Until(deadline))
```

---

# 19. Truncate

Round down.

```go
now := time.Now()

fmt.Println(now.Truncate(time.Minute))
```

Milliseconds

```go
now.Truncate(time.Millisecond)
```

---

# 20. Round

```go
fmt.Println(time.Now().Round(time.Minute))
```

---

# 21. Parsing with Time Zone

```go
t, err := time.Parse(
    time.RFC3339,
    "2026-07-16T10:30:00Z",
)

fmt.Println(t)
```

---

# 22. Local Time

```go
fmt.Println(time.Now().Local())
```

---

# 23. Difference Between Two Times

```go
start := time.Now()

end := start.Add(3*time.Hour + 15*time.Minute)

diff := end.Sub(start)

fmt.Println(diff)
```

Output

```
3h15m0s
```

---

# 24. Useful Duration Methods

```go
d := 90 * time.Minute

fmt.Println(d.Hours())
fmt.Println(d.Minutes())
fmt.Println(d.Seconds())
```

Output

```
1.5
90
5400
```

---

# 25. Is Zero Time?

```go
var t time.Time

fmt.Println(t.IsZero())
```

Output

```
true
```

---

# 26. JSON Support

Go automatically marshals `time.Time` as RFC3339.

```go
type User struct {
    CreatedAt time.Time `json:"created_at"`
}
```

JSON

```json
{
  "created_at":"2026-07-16T15:30:12Z"
}
```

---

# 27. Common Pitfalls

### 1. Formatting

Incorrect:

```go
time.Format("YYYY-MM-DD")
```

Correct:

```go
time.Format("2006-01-02")
```

Go layouts always use the reference date `2006-01-02 15:04:05`.

### 2. Use `AddDate` for Calendar Arithmetic

Avoid adding `30 * 24 * time.Hour` to represent "one month"; months have different lengths.

```go
t.AddDate(0, 1, 0)
```

### 3. Time Zones

When parsing or displaying user-facing dates, be explicit about the location if it matters. `time.Parse` without a time zone assumes UTC for layouts without zone information.

| Time zone          | `LoadLocation()`, `In()`         |

## Best Practices

* Store timestamps internally in UTC whenever practical, and convert to local time only when presenting data to users.
* Prefer `AddDate` for months and years, and `Add` with `time.Duration` for fixed intervals like hours or seconds.
* Use the predefined layouts (such as `time.RFC3339`) when exchanging timestamps with APIs.
* Always check errors from `time.Parse` and `time.LoadLocation`, since invalid input or unknown time zones can fail.

Once you're comfortable with the basics, a natural next step is learning how `context.Context` uses deadlines and timeouts, since it builds directly on Go's time APIs and is widely used in networking, databases, and concurrent programs.


# Execution time in golang
Measuring execution time in Go is straightforward using the `time` package. The most common pattern is:

```go
start := time.Now()

// Code to measure
doSomething()

elapsed := time.Since(start)

fmt.Println("Execution time:", elapsed)
```

Example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	start := time.Now()

	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)

	elapsed := time.Since(start)

	fmt.Printf("Execution time: %v\n", elapsed)
}
```

Output:

```
Execution time: 2.000123456s
```

---

## Using `Sub()`

`time.Since(start)` is simply a convenience for:

```go
start := time.Now()

// Work

end := time.Now()

elapsed := end.Sub(start)

fmt.Println(elapsed)
```

Equivalent to:

```go
elapsed := time.Since(start)
```

---

## Getting Time in Different Units

A `time.Duration` can be converted into different units:

```go
start := time.Now()

time.Sleep(1500 * time.Millisecond)

elapsed := time.Since(start)

fmt.Printf("Nanoseconds: %d\n", elapsed.Nanoseconds())
fmt.Printf("Microseconds: %d\n", elapsed.Microseconds())
fmt.Printf("Milliseconds: %d\n", elapsed.Milliseconds())
fmt.Printf("Seconds: %.3f\n", elapsed.Seconds())
```

Output:

```
Nanoseconds: 1500123456
Microseconds: 1500123
Milliseconds: 1500
Seconds: 1.500
```

---

## Timing a Function

A common helper function:

```go
func slowFunction() {
	time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
}

func main() {
	start := time.Now()

	slowFunction()

	fmt.Println(time.Since(start))
}
```

---

## Using `defer` (Very Common)

This pattern is widely used for logging how long a function takes:

```go
func measure(name string) func() {
	start := time.Now()

	return func() {
		fmt.Printf("%s took %v\n", name, time.Since(start))
	}
}

func processData() {
	defer measure("processData")()

	time.Sleep(750 * time.Millisecond)
}

func main() {
	processData()
}
```

Output:

```
processData took 750.123456ms
```

The `defer` statement ensures the timing is printed when the function returns, regardless of which return path is taken.

---

## Benchmarking Small Operations

If you're measuring a very fast operation (microseconds or nanoseconds), run it many times to get a more stable average:

```go
start := time.Now()

for i := 0; i < 1_000_000; i++ {
	_ = i * i
}

elapsed := time.Since(start)

fmt.Printf("Total: %v\n", elapsed)
fmt.Printf("Average: %v\n", elapsed/time.Duration(1_000_000))
```

---

## For Accurate Performance Testing

For measuring the performance of Go functions, prefer the built-in benchmarking framework in the `testing` package instead of manual timing.

```go
func BenchmarkMyFunction(b *testing.B) {
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		myFunction()
	}
}
```

Run it with:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

This framework automatically:

* Runs the function many times (`b.N` iterations).
* Adjusts the number of iterations to get reliable results.
* Reports metrics such as nanoseconds per operation (`ns/op`), and optionally memory allocations (`B/op`, `allocs/op`).

### Which approach should you use?

| Scenario                                | Recommended approach                        |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Measure a block of code while debugging | `start := time.Now()` + `time.Since(start)` |
| Log how long a function takes           | `defer` + `time.Since()`                    |
| Compare algorithm performance           | Manual timing with multiple runs            |
| Benchmark production code               | `go test -bench`                            |
| Measure memory allocations too          | `go test -bench -benchmem`                  |

For day-to-day development, `time.Now()` and `time.Since()` are the idiomatic choice. When you need reproducible performance measurements, Go's benchmark framework is the standard tool.
