### 📘 **Structure of a Make Rule**

A complete rule looks like this:

```make
target: prerequisites
<TAB>recipe line 1
<TAB>recipe line 2
...
```

- **`target`** — the file (or phony name) you want to build.
    
- **`prerequisites`** — files that the target depends on.
    
- **`recipe lines`** — the commands Make executes (each line runs in a shell).
    

---

### ✅ **Example 1**

```make
hello: hello.c
	gcc -o hello hello.c
```

Here:

- `hello` is the **target** (the executable we want to build).
    
- `hello.c` is the **prerequisite** (the source file).
    
- `gcc -o hello hello.c` is the **recipe line**.
    

When you run:

```bash
make hello
```

Make will execute:

```bash
gcc -o hello hello.c
```

### ✅ **Example 2**

```make
blah: blah.o 
	cc blah.o -o blah # Runs third 
blah.o: blah.c 
	cc -c blah.c -o blah.o # Runs second
blah.c:
	echo 'int main() { return 0;}' > blah.c # Runs first
```

### The dependency graph

You can think of it as a directed graph (often visualized as a tree for simple cases):

```text
blah
│
└── blah.o
    │
    └── blah.c
```

When you run:

```bash
make blah
```

`make` starts with the target `blah` and recursively ensures that each dependency is up to date **before** deciding whether to rebuild the target itself.

This is similar to a **post-order traversal** in this example:

1. Visit `blah`
2. Visit `blah.o`
3. Visit `blah.c`
4. Determine whether `blah.c` needs rebuilding.
5. Return to `blah.o`, determine whether it needs rebuilding.
6. Return to `blah`, determine whether it needs rebuilding.

So the execution order is indeed from the leaves upward.

---

### First run

Suppose none of the files exist.

`make` checks `blah`.

* It depends on `blah.o`, so `make` checks `blah.o`.
* `blah.o` depends on `blah.c`, so `make` checks `blah.c`.
* `blah.c` doesn't exist, but there is a rule to build it:

```make
blah.c:
	echo "int main() { return 0; }" > blah.c
```

So this command runs.

Now `blah.c` exists.

`make` returns to `blah.o`.

* `blah.o` doesn't exist.
* Therefore it must be built:

```make
cc -c blah.c -o blah.o
```

Now `blah.o` exists.

`make` returns to `blah`.

* `blah` doesn't exist.
* Therefore it must be built:

```make
cc blah.o -o blah
```

So the commands execute exactly in this order:

```
echo ...
cc -c ...
cc ...
```

Notice that for `blah.o` and `blah`, the reason isn't that the dependency is newer—it is simply that the target doesn't exist. A missing target is always rebuilt.

---

### Second run

Now all three files exist.

Again, `make` walks the dependency graph.

#### `blah.c`

It already exists.

There are no prerequisites for `blah.c`, so it is considered up to date.

No command runs.

#### `blah.o`

Now `make` compares timestamps.

* Is `blah.o` missing? No.
* Is `blah.c` newer than `blah.o`? No.

Therefore:

```
cc -c blah.c -o blah.o
```

does **not** run.

#### `blah`

Again:

* Is `blah` missing? No.
* Is `blah.o` newer than `blah`? No.

Therefore:

```
cc blah.o -o blah
```

does **not** run.

So your description is correct.

---

### One subtle point

In the second run :

> `make` first checks whether `blah.c` itself needs to be rebuilt.

In this case it doesn't, because:

* `blah.c` exists.
* It has no prerequisites that could make it out of date.

So the recipe isn't executed.

---

### General rule that `make` follows

For every target:

1. First recursively update all prerequisites.
2. Then decide whether the target itself is out of date.
3. Rebuild the target if:

   * it doesn't exist, **or**
   * any prerequisite has a newer modification time.

That's the core algorithm behind `make`, and your explanation matches it well.

### ⚙️ **Important Rules About Recipe Lines**

| Rule                           | Explanation                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Must start with a TAB**      | Every recipe line **must begin with a tab character**, not spaces. (You can change this with `.RECIPEPREFIX`.) |
| **Runs in a shell**            | Each recipe line is executed by a **separate shell instance** (usually `/bin/sh`).                             |
| **Variables expand first**     | Before running the recipe, Make expands variables like `$(CC)` or `$(CFLAGS)`.                                 |
| **Default shell is `/bin/sh`** | You can override it with `SHELL = /bin/bash`.                                                                  |
| **Each line runs separately**  | Unless you use `\` or `&&`, commands on different lines do **not share state** (like `cd` directories).        |

---

### ⚠️ **Example: Each line in a separate shell**

```make
build:
	cd src
	gcc main.c -o main
```

❌ This fails, because the `cd src` happens in one shell, and `gcc` runs in another.

✅ Correct way:

```make
build:
	cd src && gcc main.c -o main
```

---

### 🧠 **Tips & Tricks**

- **Suppress command echo:** Prefix with `@`
    
    ```make
    clean:
    	@rm -f *.o
    ```
    
    (This hides the command output in the terminal.)
    
- **Ignore errors:** Prefix with `-`
    
    ```make
    clean:
    	-rm -f *.o
    ```
    
    (Make continues even if `rm` fails.)
    
- **Use variables:**
    
    ```make
    CC = gcc
    CFLAGS = -Wall -O2
    
    main: main.c
    	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o main main.c
    ```

Two Kinds of Variables in a Makefile

There are **Make variables** and **shell variables**, and they live in **completely different worlds**.

- **Make variables** exist in Make’s own parsing and expansion phase.  
    → They are evaluated _before_ the shell command runs.
    
- **Shell variables** exist in the shell environment when Make executes the recipe.  
    → They are created _inside_ the shell process for that rule.
    

---

## ⚙️ 1. Declaring a Variable _Inside a Rule_

Example:

```make
build:
    X=hello
    echo $$X
```

### What’s happening here?

- `X=hello` is **not** a Make variable assignment — it’s a **shell variable** because it’s inside the recipe.
    
- Each recipe line runs in a separate shell (by default), so:
    
    - `X=hello` is set in one shell instance.
        
    - `echo $$X` runs in a _different_ shell instance (so `$X` is empty).
        

Output:

```
# nothing printed
```

Note:  we use the double dollar `$$`  in echo command, because make uses `$` for its own variable expansion before it passes the command to shell.
so when we use `$$`  make sees it and replaces it with single `$`.  so the echo command becomes
`echo $x`


---

## ✅ 2. Keeping the Variable in the Same Shell

If you want the variable to persist across multiple lines of a recipe, you must either:

### **Option 1: Use a backslash to continue the line**

```make
build:
    X=hello; \
    echo $$X
```

✅ Output:

```
hello
```

Here, Make sends the entire line as one command to the shell.

### **Option 2: Use `.ONESHELL:`**

This directive makes Make run _all_ recipe lines in the same shell instance.

```make
.ONESHELL:
build:
    X=hello
    echo $$X
```

✅ Output:

```
hello
```

## ⚡ 3. Summary: Variable Scope and Behavior

| Location                                    | Type                     | Lifetime               | Syntax      | Example       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Top-level / before rules                    | Make variable            | During Make parsing    | `FOO = bar` | `echo $(FOO)` |
| Inside a recipe                             | Shell variable           | During shell execution | `FOO=bar`   | `echo $$FOO`  |
| Inside a multi-line recipe (no `.ONESHELL`) | Separate shells per line | Lost between lines     | —           | —             |
| Inside a `.ONESHELL:` recipe                | Same shell               | Persists across lines  | —           | —             |

---

## 🔍 4. Bonus: Mixing Make and Shell Variables

You can mix them like this:

```make
GREETING = world

build:
    echo "Make says: $(GREETING)"
    NAME=$(GREETING); echo "Shell says: $$NAME"
```

Output:

```
Make says: world
Shell says: world
```

Explanation:

- `$(GREETING)` is expanded by Make _before_ the recipe runs.
    
- `$$(...)` becomes `$(...)` when Make passes it to the shell.
    

---

✅ **Key takeaway:**

> If you declare a variable _inside a rule_, it’s a **shell variable**, not a **Make variable**.  
> To persist across lines, use backslashes or `.ONESHELL:`.

---


Make has several **types of rules**, each with different behavior and use cases. Understanding these will help you write more maintainable and efficient Makefiles. I’ll break it down thoroughly.

---

## 1. **Explicit Rules**

These are the most straightforward: you explicitly specify the target and its dependencies.

**Syntax:**

```make
target: prerequisites
    recipe
```

**Example:**

```make
all: program

program: main.o util.o
    gcc main.o util.o -o program

main.o: main.c
    gcc -c main.c -o main.o

util.o: util.c
    gcc -c util.c -o util.o
```

✅ Key points:

- You control every target and dependency.
    
- Useful for small projects or when you want fine-grained control.
    
- Make will only rebuild a target if any of its prerequisites are newer.
    

---

## 2. **Pattern Rules (Implicit Rules)**

**Pattern rules** in Make allow you to define a general rule that can be applied to multiple targets that follow a **specific filename pattern**.

* **Syntax:**

```make
%.o : %.c
    command
```

Here:

* `%.o` is the **target pattern** (object files).

* `%.c` is the **prerequisite pattern** (source files).

* `%` is a wildcard that matches the stem of the filename.

* **Example:**

```make
# Compile any .c file to a .o file
%.o: %.c
    gcc -c $< -o $@
```

Explanation:

* `$<` → first prerequisite (the `.c` file)
* `$@` → target (the `.o` file)

If you have files `main.c` and `util.c`, Make will automatically know:

```bash
main.o: main.c
    gcc -c main.c -o main.o

util.o: util.c
    gcc -c util.c -o util.o
```

So you **don’t need to write a rule for every `.c` file**.
    

---

## 3. **Suffix Rules (Older Style)**

These are an older form of pattern rules, using file suffixes to define transformations.

**Syntax:**

```make
.c.o:
    gcc -c $< -o $@
```

**Explanation:**

- `.c.o:` means “how to make `.o` files from `.c` files.”
    
- `$<` → the prerequisite `.c` file
    
- `$@` → the `.o` target
    

⚠️ **Note:** Modern Make prefers **pattern rules** over suffix rules.

---

## 4. **Phony Rules**

These are targets that **don’t correspond to actual files** — they’re just labels for commands.

**Syntax:**

```make
.PHONY: clean all

clean:
    rm -f *.o program
```

✅ Key points:

- Marking a target `.PHONY` prevents Make from confusing it with a file of the same name.
    
- Common for `clean`, `all`, `install`, etc.
    

---

## 5. **Double-Colon Rules -- rarely used**

These allow you to have **multiple independent rules for the same target**, which all run in order.

**Syntax:**

```make
target :: prereq1
    recipe1

target :: prereq2
    recipe2
```

**Example:**

```make
foo :: bar
    echo "Building from bar"

foo :: baz
    echo "Building from baz"
```

✅ Use cases:

- Rare, but useful if you want independent actions for the same target without merging prerequisites.
    

---

## 6. **Static Pattern Rules**

**Static pattern rules** are used when you want to apply a **pattern rule to a specific list of files**, instead of all files that match a pattern.

* **Syntax:**

```make
targets: target-pattern: prerequisites
    commands
```

* **Example:**

```make
# Only compile specific files
objects = main.o util.o extra.o

$(objects): %.o: %.c
    gcc -c $< -o $@
```

Explanation:

* `$(objects)` → the list of targets
* `%.o: %.c` → the pattern to build each target
* `gcc -c $< -o $@` → command

Here, only `main.o`, `util.o`, and `extra.o` will be built with this rule, even if there are other `.c` files in the directory.
  

---

## 7. **Order-Only Prerequisites**

Sometimes you want a prerequisite to exist but **not trigger a rebuild** if it changes.

**Syntax:**

```make
target: normal-prereqs | order-only-prereqs
    recipe
```

**Example:**

```make
output.txt: input.txt | tempdir
    cp input.txt output.txt

tempdir:
    mkdir -p tempdir
```

✅ Explanation:

- `tempdir` will be created if missing.
    
- Changes to `tempdir` will **not** trigger rebuilding of `output.txt`.
    

---

## 8. **Recursive / Include Rules**

Make can **call itself recursively** or include other Makefiles. This isn’t a separate rule type per se, but it affects rule behavior.

**Example:**

```make
include subdir/Makefile
```

Or in a recipe:

```make
cd subdir && $(MAKE)
```

✅ Useful for multi-directory projects.

---

### ⚡ Summary Table

|Rule Type|Symbol / Syntax|When to Use|Key Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|Explicit|`target: prereq`|Small projects, full control|Make rebuilds target if prereqs are newer|
|Pattern|`%.o: %.c`|Many similar files|`%` is stem; use `$@`, `$<`, `$^`|
|Suffix (old)|`.c.o:`|Legacy code|Replaced by pattern rules|
|Phony|`.PHONY: target`|Commands with no file|Prevent conflicts with real files|
|Double-Colon|`target :: prereq`|Multiple independent rules|Each recipe runs separately|
|Static Pattern|`targets: %.o: %.c`|Limited pattern application|Only applies to listed targets|
|Order-Only|`target: normal|order`|Build prerequisite without rebuilding|
|Recursive / Include|`$(MAKE)` or `include`|Multi-directory projects|Can include or invoke other Makefiles|

---

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Difference between wildcards * and % ? 

### ✅ Short answer:

Use **`%`**, **not** `*`, for wildcards inside Make functions like `$(filter …)` or pattern rules.

---

### 📘 Explanation

| Context                      | Wildcard | Meaning                                                                                   | Example                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shell / File system**      | `*`      | Used by the **shell** (e.g., bash) to match filenames in the filesystem.                  | `ls *.c` lists all `.c` files                        |
| **Make pattern / functions** | `%`      | Used by **Make** to match text patterns inside variable expansions, rules, and functions. | `$(filter %.c, $(FILES))` keeps words ending in `.c` |

---

### 🧠 Why this matters

* The `*` wildcard is expanded by the **shell** (before Make sees it).
* The `%` wildcard is interpreted by **Make itself**.

So when you write:

```make
$(filter *.c, $(FILES))
```

Make **does not** expand `*`; it looks for the literal `*.c` word — no matches!

But this works correctly:

```make
$(filter %.c, $(FILES))
```

because `%` tells Make to match “any substring” in its own pattern system.

---

### ✅ Example

```make
FILES = main.c util.c readme.txt

# Correct:
CFILES := $(filter %.c, $(FILES))
# → main.c util.c

# Wrong (no matches):
CFILES := $(filter *.c, $(FILES))
# → (empty)
```

---

**In short:**

* Inside Make functions and pattern rules → use **`%`**
* In shell commands (e.g., after a `$(shell …)` or in recipe lines) → use **`*`**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the **`$(wildcard …)`** function in GNU Make ?

---

## 🧩 **Definition**

```make
$(wildcard pattern)
```

**Purpose:**
Expands to a **space-separated list of existing filenames** that match the given `pattern`.

---

## 🔍 **How it works**

* `$(wildcard …)` is processed **by Make itself**, *not* by the shell.
* It uses shell-style wildcards (`*`, `?`, `[abc]`, `[a-z]`, etc.).
* Only **existing files** are returned — if nothing matches, it returns an empty string.

---

## ✅ **Examples**

### Example 1: Basic usage

```make
SRC := $(wildcard *.c)
```

If your directory has:

```
main.c util.c readme.txt
```

Then:

```
SRC = main.c util.c
```

---

### Example 2: With subdirectories

```make
SRC := $(wildcard src/*.c)
```

Expands to all `.c` files in the `src/` directory, e.g.:

```
SRC = src/main.c src/util.c
```

---

### Example 3: Combined with `patsubst`

A common Makefile idiom:

```make
SRC := $(wildcard src/*.c)
OBJ := $(patsubst src/%.c, build/%.o, $(SRC))
```

If `src/` contains:

```
src/main.c  src/util.c
```

Then:

```
OBJ = build/main.o build/util.o
```

---

### Example 4: Recursive find (manual)

`$(wildcard)` does **not** search recursively — only the specified directory level.
If you want to scan subdirectories, you can combine functions:

```make
SRC := $(wildcard src/**/*.c)   # ❌ GNU Make doesn’t support ** by default
```

Instead, you’d use a shell command:

```make
SRC := $(shell find src -name '*.c')
```

---

## ⚙️ **Common Use Cases**

| Task                          | Example                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Collect all source files      | `SRC := $(wildcard *.c)`                       |
| Generate matching object list | `OBJ := $(patsubst %.c, %.o, $(SRC))`          |
| Filter or exclude files       | `SRC := $(filter-out test%.c,$(wildcard *.c))` |

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

* The pattern is interpreted relative to the **current working directory** of Make.
* It only lists **files that already exist** — so if you run Make before creating files, the list may be empty.
* If you use variables inside the pattern, Make expands them first:

  ```make
  DIR = src
  SRC := $(wildcard $(DIR)/*.c)
  ```

---

### 🧠 TL;DR

| Feature  | Behavior                                 |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Function | `$(wildcard pattern)`                    |
| Expands  | Shell-like wildcards (`*`, `?`, `[...]`) |
| Returns  | Space-separated list of existing files   |
| Used for | Automatically listing source files       |



### Why should we use `$(wildcard *.c) instead of *.c`

In a Makefile, using `$(wildcard *.c)` instead of a bare `*.c` comes down to **how and when** the wildcard is expanded.

Using just `*.c` can lead to subtle bugs because it doesn't always behave the way you'd expect a bash shell to behave.

Here is the breakdown of why `$(wildcard ...)` is the safer, preferred choice.

---

## 1. The Core Difference: Immediate vs. Delayed Expansion

* **`$(wildcard *.c)`** forces GNU Make to expand the wildcard *immediately* when the function is evaluated. It looks at the file system, finds all matching files, and turns them into a space-separated list of actual filenames (e.g., `main.c utils.c`).
* **`*.c`** is left as a literal string `*.c` by Make. It is only expanded later if it is passed to a context that natively understands wildcards (like a shell command or a target/dependency line).

---

## 2. Where Bare `*.c` Fails

The biggest issue with a bare `*.c` is using it inside **Make variables**.

### The Broken Way (Bare `*.c`)

```makefile
SRC = *.c

# If you try to manipulate the variable, it fails!
OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)  # Expected: main.o utils.o
                    # Actual: *.o (because it just replaced '.c' in the literal string '*.c')

```

Because `SRC` literally holds the text `*.c`, any string manipulation functions (like substituting `.c` with `.o`) will break. You'll end up trying to compile a file literally named `*.o`, which doesn't exist.

### The Correct Way (`$(wildcard)`)

```makefile
SRC = $(wildcard *.c) # Expands to: main.c utils.c

# Variable manipulation works perfectly!
OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)    # Expands to: main.o utils.o

```

Because `SRC` now contains actual filenames, Make can successfully loop through them and generate your object file list.

---

## 3. Where Bare `*.c` Actually Works

To be fair to the bare wildcard, Make *does* successfully expand it in two specific places:

1. **In Targets and Prerequisites:**
```makefile
# This works. Make natively expands *.c here.
my_program: *.c
    gcc *.c -o my_program

```


2. **Inside Recipes (Shell Commands):**
```makefile
clean:
    rm -f *.o # The shell expands this, not Make.

```



## Summary

While bare wildcards work fine inside recipes or dependency lines, they completely break when assigned to variables or used with Make functions.

Using `$(wildcard *.c)` ensures that you are always dealing with an **explicit list of real files** right from the start, preventing unexpected behavior down the line.


---

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


In GNU **Make**, the `$(filter …)` function is used to **select words from a list that match one or more patterns**.

---

### 📘 **Syntax**

```make
$(filter pattern..., text)
```

* **`pattern`** — one or more space-separated wildcard patterns (like `%.c`, `foo%`, etc.)
* **`text`** — a list of words to filter

---

### 🔍 **Description**

`$(filter pattern..., text)` returns only those words in `text` that match at least one of the given `pattern`s.
Patterns can use the **`%` wildcard**, which matches any substring.

---

### ✅ **Examples**

#### Example 1: Basic filtering

```make
SOURCES = main.c util.c readme.txt
CFILES := $(filter %.c, $(SOURCES))

# CFILES = main.c util.c
```

Only `.c` files are kept.

---

#### Example 2: Multiple patterns

```make
FILES = main.c util.c data.txt readme.md
CODE := $(filter %.c %.h, $(FILES))

# CODE = main.c util.c
```

Matches `.c` and `.h` files.

---

#### Example 3: Filtering by prefix

```make
OBJS = foo.o bar.o test.o
TESTS := $(filter test%, $(OBJS))

# TESTS = test.o
```

Keeps only words starting with `test`.

---

### 🚫 **Opposite Function**

If you want to **remove** matching words instead of keeping them, use:

```make
$(filter-out pattern..., text)
```

Example:

```make
SRC = main.c test.c util.c
NONTEST := $(filter-out test%, $(SRC))

# NONTEST = main.c util.c
```

---


Few of the most commonly used GNU Make functions, with short, practical examples that show how they’re typically used in real Makefiles.

---

## 🧩 1. `patsubst` — **Pattern Substitution**

**Purpose:** Replace parts of filenames that match a pattern.

**Syntax:**

```make
$(patsubst pattern,replacement,text)
```

**Example:**

```make
SRC = main.c util.c test.c
OBJ = $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(SRC))

all:
    @echo $(OBJ)
```

**Output:**

```
main.o util.o test.o
```

👉 Converts a list of `.c` files into `.o` files — *very common in Makefiles*.

---

## 📁 2. `wildcard` — **Find Files Matching a Pattern**

**Purpose:** Automatically find source files in a directory.

**Example:**

```make
SRC = $(wildcard src/*.c)

all:
    @echo $(SRC)
```

**Output (if folder has `src/main.c src/util.c`):**

```
src/main.c src/util.c
```

👉 Used to automatically collect source files without listing them manually.

---

## 🧱 3. `basename` and `suffix` — **Extract Parts of Filenames**

**Example:**

```make
FILES = main.c util.c
BASES = $(basename $(FILES))
EXTS = $(suffix $(FILES))

all:
    @echo BASES: $(BASES)
    @echo EXTS: $(EXTS)
```

**Output:**

```
BASES: main util
EXTS: .c .c
```

👉 Helps when you need to generate file names or check extensions.

---

## ⚙️ 4. `addprefix` and `addsuffix`

**Purpose:** Add prefixes or suffixes to a list of words (often file paths).

**Example:**

```make
FILES = main util
SRC = $(addsuffix .c,$(FILES))
OBJ = $(addprefix build/,$(addsuffix .o,$(FILES)))

all:
    @echo SRC: $(SRC)
    @echo OBJ: $(OBJ)
```

**Output:**

```
SRC: main.c util.c
OBJ: build/main.o build/util.o
```

👉 Common for building directory paths like `build/main.o`.

---

## 🔄 5. `foreach` — **Loop Over a List**

**Example:**

```make
FILES = main.c util.c
OBJS = $(foreach f,$(FILES),$(basename $(f)).o)

all:
    @echo $(OBJS)
```

**Output:**

```
main.o util.o
```

👉 Useful when you want more control than `patsubst` provides.

---

## 🧠 6. `if` — **Conditional Logic**

**Example:**

```make
DEBUG = yes
CFLAGS = $(if $(DEBUG),-g,-O2)

all:
    @echo CFLAGS: $(CFLAGS)
```

**Output:**

```
CFLAGS: -g
```

👉 Used to conditionally choose compiler flags or options.

---

## 🧰 7. `shell` — **Run Shell Commands**

**Example:**

```make
DATE := $(shell date +%Y-%m-%d)

all:
    @echo Build date: $(DATE)
```

**Output:**

```
Build date: 2025-11-07
```

👉 Used for pulling system info (date, Git hash, etc.) into Makefiles.

---

## ⚠️ 8. `error` and `warning`

**Example:**

```make
SRC =

ifeq ($(SRC),)
$(error No source files specified!)
endif
```

**Output:**

```
Makefile:3: *** No source files specified!.  Stop.
```

👉 Very helpful for input validation in large projects.

Perfect 👍 — let’s build a **mini but realistic Makefile** that automatically finds source files, converts them to object files, and builds a final executable — all using the most useful GNU Make functions we discussed.

---

## 🧱 **Example: Automatic C Project Makefile**

```make
# -------------------------
# Project Settings
# -------------------------
CC      := gcc
CFLAGS  := -Wall -O2
TARGET  := app

# -------------------------
# Automatically find all .c files
# -------------------------
SRC := $(wildcard src/*.c)

# Generate corresponding .o files in build/
OBJ := $(addprefix build/,$(notdir $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(SRC))))

# -------------------------
# Build Rules
# -------------------------

# Default target
all: $(TARGET)

# Link the final executable
$(TARGET): $(OBJ)
	@echo "Linking $@..."
	$(CC) $(OBJ) -o $@

# Compile .c → .o (pattern rule)
build/%.o: src/%.c | build
	@echo "Compiling $<..."
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

# Ensure build directory exists
build:
	mkdir -p build

# -------------------------
# Utility Targets
# -------------------------
clean:
	@echo "Cleaning up..."
	rm -rf build $(TARGET)

# -------------------------
# Optional: Debug Info
# -------------------------
debug:
	@echo "Sources: $(SRC)"
	@echo "Objects: $(OBJ)"
	@echo "Compiler Flags: $(CFLAGS)"
```

## 🔍 **Explanation**

|Line|Function Used|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|`$(wildcard src/*.c)`|`wildcard`|Automatically find all `.c` files in `src/`|
|`$(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(SRC))`|`patsubst`|Change `.c` → `.o`|
|`$(notdir ...)`|`notdir`|Remove directory prefix (only filename)|
|`$(addprefix build/,...)`|`addprefix`|Put object files into the `build/` directory|
|`build/%.o: src/%.c`|Pattern rule|Generic rule for building each object file|
|`|build`|Order-only prerequisite|
|`@echo`|Command echo|Used for clean, readable output|

## 🧪 **Example Folder Structure**

```
project/
├── Makefile
├── src/
│   ├── main.c
│   ├── util.c
│   └── math.c
```

---

## 🧰 **Running It**

```bash
$ make
Compiling src/main.c...
Compiling src/util.c...
Compiling src/math.c...
Linking app...

$ make debug
Sources: src/main.c src/util.c src/math.c
Objects: build/main.o build/util.o build/math.o
Compiler Flags: -Wall -O2

$ make clean
Cleaning up...
```

---

This Makefile uses:

- `wildcard` → find files
    
- `patsubst`, `notdir`, `addprefix` → generate target names
    
- pattern rule (`build/%.o: src/%.c`) → compile generically
    
- `| build` → ensure directory exists only when needed
    
- `@echo` → for clean logs
